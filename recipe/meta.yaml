  summary: comprehensive password hashing framework supporting over 30 schemes
  description: |
    Passlib is a password hashing library for Python, which provides
    cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms, as
    well as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It's designed to
    be useful for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash found in
    /etc/shadow, to providing full-strength password hashing for multi-user
    applications.
